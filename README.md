Every day, I commit a new and more complicated version of some simple code. 

See https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/y6iuto/lets_do_it/

Day 1:
Created simple code that prints "Hello world!" 10 times.
See https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/y6iuto/lets_do_it/

Day 2:
Replaced the for loop with ```for i in ("HelloWorld"):```

Day 3:
Replaced the hard-coded "Hello World!" with the constant HW

Day 4:
Converted part of code to C for faster runtime

Day 5:
Replaced the string in for loop to a highly-efficient defined string.
